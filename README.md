# MNIST Handwritten Digits Project Revisit

This is a revisit to a project I did in undergrad as part of my preparation for research in computer vision. 
The original project was written in 2019 using MATLAB, while this project uses Python.
[MNIST.py](https://github.com/tagarwal-NCSU/MNIST/blob/main/MNIST.py) is the barebones algorithm that I used to identify the handwritten digits, and is only 19 lines of code.
[MNIST.ipynb](https://github.com/tagarwal-NCSU/MNIST/blob/main/MNIST.ipynb) contains all of the code I used to make the visualizations and other interesting tidbits as well.
